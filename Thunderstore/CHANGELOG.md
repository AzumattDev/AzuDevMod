| 1.0.8     | - Add checks for missing Player.m_firstSpawn that 0.218.16 (currently in PTB) cause.

| 1.0.6     | - Fix some things in code. Again! Funny how that works.  <br/>- Clean up logging/code a bit by creating a centralized method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 1.0.2     | - The last addition to the mod is more for mod developers to debug. It caused issues with closing to desktop/crashing for any modpack or setup that used obfuscated mods. It's now been blocked behind a configuration value.<br/> - Add configurations for the mod to toggle what patches are running. By default, all of them run besides the one setting in the Mod Developer section of the configurations (the last addition from 1.0.1) because of the crashing issues with KeyManager/Obfuscated mods. |
| 1.0.1     | - Add ability to find GameObjects that are added to ZNetScene's m_prefabs twice, which causes issues. Made the code a bit expansive should I need that later.<br/> - Clean up                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
